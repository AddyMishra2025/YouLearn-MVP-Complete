# Research Synthesis 

## Summary of Insights
1. **Learners want structured, role-based paths** rather than piecing together disparate content.
2. **Speed-to-value matters**: fast onboarding, short lessons, and clear time estimates reduce drop-off.
3. **Confidence is built through guidance**: “why this lesson” context, AI summaries, and stepwise difficulty progression reduce uncertainty.
4. **Progress visibility motivates completion**: milestones, streaks, and achievements increase engagement.
5. **Social proof and sharing are motivating**: testimonials and shareable achievements reinforce commitment.
